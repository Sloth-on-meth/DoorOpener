## v[1.10.0] - 2025-09-16

### 👥 User Management & Migration System
- **NEW**: Complete admin UI for user management with tabbed interface (Logs/Users)
- **NEW**: JSON-based user store (`users.json`) with atomic operations and host persistence
- **NEW**: "Migrate All" functionality to bulk migrate config-only users from `config.ini` to JSON store
- **NEW**: Full CRUD operations for JSON store users (Create, Edit, Delete, Activate/Deactivate)
- **NEW**: Toast notifications throughout admin UI replacing blocking alert dialogs
- **NEW**: Log management with "Clear Test Data" and "Clear All Logs" buttons
- **NEW**: Button busy states with inline progress indicators for long-running operations
- **IMPROVED**: User PIN resolution now prioritizes JSON store over config.ini entries
- **IMPROVED**: Migration process removes users from config.ini after successful JSON store creation
- **IMPROVED**: Admin UI uses modern modals and responsive design patterns
- **BREAKING**: Individual user migration removed - use "Migrate All" for bulk operations
- **DEPRECATION**: config.ini [pins] section will be removed in a future version - migrate to JSON store

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Added `users.json` volume bind in docker-compose.yml for data persistence
- Simplified config.ini writing to avoid temporary file permission issues
- Enhanced error handling and logging for user management operations
- Added `user_exists()` method to UsersStore class
- Improved admin session authentication across all user management endpoints

### 📝 Migration Instructions
- Existing config.ini [pins] users can be migrated via Admin → Users → "Migrate All"
- Migration preserves existing PINs and removes entries from config.ini
- JSON store users gain full management capabilities (edit PIN, activate/deactivate)
- No downtime required - config and JSON users work simultaneously during transition

## v[1.9.0] - 2025-09-16

### 🔐 TLS & Self‑Signed Certificates
- Added support for trusting a custom CA bundle for Home Assistant HTTPS requests.
- New `[HomeAssistant] ca_bundle` option in `config.ini` allows pointing to a PEM bundle.
- When set and readable, all HA `requests.get/post` calls use `verify=<ca_bundle>`.
- When not set, default system trust store is used (`verify=True`).
- README updated with Docker compose mount examples and env var alternatives (`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`).

### 🛡️ Security Headers
- Introduced per‑request CSP nonce and applied it to inline scripts in `templates/index.html` and `templates/admin.html`.
- CSP tightened to rely on nonces for scripts, with a safe fallback when nonce generation fails.

### 🔑 OIDC Logout Behavior
- Restored 500 responses when the OIDC well‑known or `end_session_endpoint` is missing to align with tests/expectations.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added SSL tests to ensure `verify=True` by default (no ca_bundle) and `verify=<path>` when a bundle is configured for both GET and POST HA calls.
- Adjusted admin auth tests to accept non‑blocking delay responses (HTTP 429) for progressive delays before blocking.

### 📝 CI & Linting
- pycodestyle step is now non‑blocking in CI (`continue-on-error: true`), emitting warnings instead of failing the job.
- Fixed PEP 8 style (E203/E302) and Ruff issues (`Response` typing, removed unused import).

### 📦 Version
- Bumped version to 1.9.0.

## v[1.8.0] - 2025-09-11

### 🚀 PWA & Installability
- Added Web App Manifest and Service Worker to enable install on mobile/desktop.
- Register Service Worker on load; added in-app "Install App" button (Android/Chrome).
- Manifest and icons wired; Apple touch icon supported via existing favicon.

### 🎛️ Keypad & UX
- Auto-submit is now debounced: users can type 4–8 digits; submit fires after a short pause.
- Keyboard auto-repeat is ignored to prevent floods from held keys.
- Submission lock prevents concurrent requests.
- "ACCESS GRANTED / DENIED" popups now appear above the glass card.

### 🔒 Security & Blocking
- Enforce active blocks even when a correct PIN or valid OIDC session is used.
- Persist session block across workers via signed cookie (`blocked_until_ts`).
- All block responses now include `blocked_until` (epoch seconds) for client countdowns.
- Frontend shows a live countdown toast until the block expires.

### 🧪 Tests
- Added tests verifying:
  - Correct PIN during active block still returns 429 and includes `blocked_until`.
  - Persisted session block denies OIDC pinless open and includes `blocked_until`.

### 🛠️ CI & Linting
- Removed Black from CI to avoid repo-vs-image formatting differences.
- `lint` job now runs Ruff only; separate pycodestyle workflow runs style checks without formatting.

### 📦 Version
- Bumped version to 1.8.0.

## v[1.7.0] - 2025-09-08

### 🔒 Security Enhancements (OIDC & App)
- OIDC now fully gated: all OIDC functionality is disabled unless the OAuth client is initialized and `enabled=true` in `[oidc]`.
- Added CSRF protection via `state` and replay protection via `nonce` in the OIDC flow.
- Enabled PKCE (`S256`).
- Strict token validation: issuer (`iss`) check, audience (`aud`) supports list or string, expiration (`exp`) and not‑before (`nbf`) with 60s leeway.
- Session fixation protection: session is cleared after successful token validation before setting auth data.
- Pinless open only when: OIDC enabled, session valid (non‑expired), user in allowed group (if configured), and `require_pin_for_oidc=false`.
- Hardened security headers: strong CSP, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`, `Permissions-Policy`, strict referrer policy, and no‑cache on dynamic endpoints.
- Admin login protected with progressive delays and temporary session blocking; all attempts are now audit‑logged.

### 🧪 Tests & CI
- Expanded OIDC tests: state/nonce, expired session behavior, pinless success, invalid state rejection, login redirect behavior, and OIDC gating.
- CI pushes Docker image to GHCR on every push using `docker/login-action` with PAT or `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback.

### 🐳 Docker & Runtime
- Adopted linuxserver.io‑style `PUID`/`PGID`/`UMASK` pattern for painless host permissions.
- New `entrypoint.sh` aligns runtime user/group to host IDs, ensures `/app/logs` is writable, applies umask, then drops privileges via `gosu`.
- Fixed Debian package availability in `python:3.9-slim` (trixie) by installing `passwd` (provides `useradd`/`groupadd`) instead of `shadow`.
- `docker-compose.yml` updated to include `PUID`, `PGID`, `UMASK` envs; `config.ini` stays read‑only; `logs/` is writeable.

### 📝 Logging & Observability
- Switched to `RotatingFileHandler` for both access and audit logs to prevent unbounded growth.
- All logs centralized under `/app/logs/` (mount `./logs:/app/logs`).

### 🎨 UI/UX
- Frontend SSO button visibility now strictly follows backend `oidc_enabled` flag.
- Added missing `openDoorWithSSO()` function to make SSO button functional.

### 📚 Documentation
- README refreshed with compose example, `PUID/PGID/UMASK`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, and logging paths in linuxserver.io style.
- `.env.example` updated with new envs.
- `config.ini.example` gains optional `[oidc] public_key` for local token signature validation.

### 🙏 Acknowledgements
- Thanks to @hanneshier for the idea and contributions around the OIDC flow.
- Thanks to @remijn for fixing my docker build flow
